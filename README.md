Welcome to my data science portfolio! Here you'll find a selection of projects I've completed that showcase my skills in statistical modeling, machine learning, and data visualization. 

Each project includes a detailed README file that explains the goals, methodology, tools used, and results in greater depth. Feel free to explore and dive into anything that interests you!

## Projects

### Neural Network Classifier (Python, NumPy, Pandas)
Built a neural network from scratch in Python using only NumPy. Implemented backpropagation, stochastic gradient descent, and a full training pipline. Tuned hyperparameters to improve performance across multiple datasets.

### Brain MRI Shape Analysis (Python, geomstats)
Used Kendall shape space and energy-distance permutation testing to compare brain images from Alzheimer’s patients vs controls. Combined hierarchical clustering and visualization to present a clear explanation of group-level differences.

### Impact of Climbing on Bird Populations (R, tidverse, glmnet, randomForest, mgcv, corrplot)
Applied logistic regression, Generalized Additive Models (GAMs), penalized regression, and ensemble models to evaluate how recreational climbing impacts nesting bird populations.
