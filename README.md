## Projects

### Neural Network Classifier (Python, NumPy, Pandas)
Built a fully connected neural network from scratch using NumPy. Implemented backpropagation and SGD. Tuned hyperparameters to improve performance across 4 datasets.

### Impact of Climbing on Bird Populations (R, tidverse, glmnet, )
Analyzed data from a published study on how recreational climbing affects nesting bird populations. Reproduced and extended the original paper’s findings using custom R code and basic regression modeling. Interpreted ecological implications and communicated findings in a formal scientific-style report.
