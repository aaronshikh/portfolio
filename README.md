Welcome to my data science portfolio! Here you'll find a selection of projects I've completed that showcase my skills in statistical modeling, machine learning, and data visualization. 

Each project includes a detailed README file that explains the goals, methodology, tools used, and results in greater depth. Feel free to explore and dive into anything that interests you!

## Projects

### **[Neural Network Classifier](https://github.com/aaronshikh/Neural-Net)** (Python, NumPy, Pandas)
Built a neural network from scratch in Python using only NumPy. Implemented backpropagation, stochastic gradient descent, and a full training pipline. Tuned hyperparameters to improve performance across multiple datasets.

### **[Brain MRI Shape Analysis](https://github.com/aaronshikh/Shape-Analysis-Alzheimer-s-)** (Python, geomstats)
Used Kendall shape space and energy-distance permutation testing to compare brain images from Alzheimer’s patients vs controls. Combined hierarchical clustering and visualization to present a clear explanation of group-level differences.

### **[Impact of Climbing on Bird Populations](https://github.com/aaronshikh/Impact-of-Rock-Climbing-on-Bird-Populations)** (R, tidverse, glmnet, randomForest, mgcv, corrplot)
Applied logistic regression, Generalized Additive Models (GAMs), penalized regression, and ensemble models to evaluate how recreational climbing impacts nesting bird populations.
